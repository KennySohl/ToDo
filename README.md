# ToDo
**What is this?**

A Spring 5 Java application for a To Do list.
This application uses JDBC to store the ToDo list.

**With this application you can:** 

-Add a ToDo item

-Remove a ToDo item


I Did not add a frontend interface to focus on the backend application. 

I did not change anything from my User Stories or Entityâ€“relationship model
